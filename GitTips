To keep a project small and efficient, you should only track source files and omit anything that can be generated from those files
git add index.html
tells git to start tarcking index.html
A snapshot represents the state of your project at a given point in time.
Git's term for creating a snapshot is called staging becuase we can add or remove multiple files before actually committing it to the 
project history. Staging gives us the opportunity to group related changes into distinct snapshots - a practice that makes it possible 
to track the meaningful progression of a software project
